First, the given unlabeled dataset is first
manually assiged labels (food or interior).
Second, the following models are fine‚Äêtuned on the 
labeled dataset: Alexnet, VGG, ResNet,
Vision Transformer (ViT) and ConvNeXT.
ViT is chosen as a final model based on the
performance of the models in terms of the validation 
\accuracy. Moreover, further experiments are conducted
to improve the performance of ViT.
